    Step 1. Install a supported version of Python on your system (note: that the system install of Python on macOS is not supported).
    Step 2. Install the Python extension for Visual Studio Code.
    Step 3. Open or create a Python file and start coding!

## Features

# IntelliSense and auto-completions
https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/editing#_autocomplete-and-intellisense
IntelliSense and auto-completions work for standard Python modules as well as other packages you've installed into the environment 
of the selected Python interpreter. It also provides completions for methods available on object types.

# Linting
https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/linting
Linting highlights syntactical and stylistic problems in your Python source code, which oftentimes helps you identify and correct 
subtle programming errors or unconventional coding practices that can lead to errors.
devcontainer.json:
    - "python.linting.pylintEnabled": true - Specifies whether to enable Pylint
    - "python.linting.enabled": true - Specifies whether to enable linting in general

# Jupyter Notebooks
https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/jupyter-support
To work with Jupyter notebooks, you must activate an Anaconda environment in VS Code, or another Python environment in which 
you've installed the Jupyter package. Once the appropriate environment is activated, you can create and run Jupyter-like code cells, 
connect to a remote Jupyter server for running code cells, open a Jupyter notebook directly, and export Python files as Jupyter notebooks.

## Pylint

Pylint is a source-code, bug and quality checker for the Python programming language.
