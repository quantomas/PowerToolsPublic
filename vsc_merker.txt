# Remote - Containers installation:
# If you run "git config --global core.autocrlf false", this might cause problems with text files (e.g. python code from a file is merged into one line)
# To reset, run "git config --global core.autocrlf true" and reclone corresponding repositories


### Additional components and tools:

## Git
https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/additional-components
Git - VS Code has built-in support for source code control using Git but requires Git to be installed separately.

## Docker
# Docker Support for Visual Studio Code
# The Docker extension contributes a new Docker View to VS Code. Within the View, the Explorer lets you view and manage your Images, Containers,
# and browse your Docker Hub registry. If the Azure Account extension is installed, you can browse your Azure Container Registries as well.
# With the Docker Explorer you can deploy images from Docker Hub Registries or Azure Container Registries directly to an Azure App Service instance,
# as detailed in this getting started guide. This functionality requires installing the Azure Account extension and an Azure Subscription.
