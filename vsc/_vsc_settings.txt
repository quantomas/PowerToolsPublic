* User Settings - Settings that apply globally to any instance of VS Code you open.
Depending on your platform, the user settings file is located here:
Windows %APPDATA%\Code\User\settings.json

* Workspace Settings - Settings stored inside your workspace and only apply when the workspace is opened.
The workspace settings file is located under the .vscode folder in your root folder.


>> Workspace settings override user settings. Workspace settings are specific to a project and can be shared across developers on a project.

>> Changes to settings are reloaded by VS Code as you change them.


The easiest way to reset VS Code back to the default settings is to clear your user settings.json file contents in the Settings editor.
Delete everything between the two curly braces, save the file, and VS Code will go back to using the default values.


When does it make sense to use workspace settings?
If you're using a workspace that needs custom settings but you don't want to apply them to your other VS Code projects.
A good example is language-specific linting rules.
